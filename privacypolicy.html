        <p>
            Last Updated: 12/14/2020<br>

            Your privacy is important to us. Rodan & Fields, LLC, including all its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Rodan + Fields," "we," "our," and "us"), has created this Privacy Policy to help you become familiar with how we collect, use, disclose, share, and protect information that can reasonably be used to identify a natural person directly or indirectly ("Personal Information"). We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy in its entirety before using our Site or otherwise submitting Personal Information to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">SCOPE</span><br>

This Privacy Policy governs our practices with regards to Personal Information collected when you access or use the Rodan + Fields® website (or any of our international websites or applications) and any products, services, software, tools, applications, features or functionality offered on or through the website or mobile application (including any Rodan + Fields Independent Consultant personal web pages provided through the website) (collectively, the “Site”). You may be accessing our Site from a computer or mobile phone device (for example, through an iPhone or iPad application) or through a Rodan + Fields mobile application, and the provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to all such mobile access and use of mobile devices. From time to time, we may add additional products, services, software, tools, applications, features or functionality, offered through our websites or mobile applications as we expand our offerings, and this Privacy Policy will govern those new products, services, software, tools, applications, features, or functionality when added. If you provide Personal Information about yourself to us while using our Site, you consent to our collection, processing, use, and transfer of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to applicable laws.

We also may interact with you on third-party websites where we post content or invite your feedback, including websites such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube ("Third-Party Sites"). Please read the privacy policies of those Third-Party Sites and social platforms because the information they collect, including the posts you publish, will be governed by their Privacy Policies respectively, except to the extent you provide or disclose your Personal Information to us via a private messaging function. In addition, if you access third party websites or applications (including by providing such third parties your Rodan + Fields credentials), and share your Personal Information with such third parties, please read the privacy policies of those third parties to learn more about their collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OUR INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS.
        </p>
        <p>
           <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</span>
            <br>

Because our business will continue to evolve, our policies will be reviewed and may be revised from time to time. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify you by posting an updated version of the Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy from time to time during visits to the Site and note any changes before your continued use of the Site. Your continued use of the Site after we post any revisions to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to periodically check this page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we might disclose it. The amended Privacy Policy will apply between us whether or not we have given you specific notice of any change. By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, please do not use the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU</span>  <br>

We collect the following types of Personal Information in order to provide you with the use of the Site and to help us personalize and improve your experience.
       
</p>
<p>
  1.  Information We Collect Automatically: When you use the Site, we collect information sent to us by your computer or mobile device. The information sent to us includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
</p>
<p>
   a. Location, device, and connection information: We collect location data (including IP addresses), device and connection information (such as referral URL). Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, analyzing trends, including suspicious activity detection and prevention, administering the Site, tracking traffic patterns, and gathering geographic information for aggregate use. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. If you access the Site or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your device identifiers, location, and other similar mobile device data.
</p>
<p>
   b. Environmental Variables: We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, internet browser, and internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and will be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
</p>
<p>
   c. Cookies and other Tracking Technologies: We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect data while you use our Site. This data is typically collected from the devices (including mobile devices) that you use. Please see our section in Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies below for more information.
</p>
<p>
  2.  Information You Provide To Us: We may collect and store any information you provide us when you use the Site. For example, when you decide to complete a user registration form, complete an online survey, or make a purchase, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number). If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know your delivery and billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. Enrolling Independent Consultants are also asked to provide their date of birth, Social Security number, and other Personal Information, which is required in order to begin a consultantship.
</p>
<p>
    We may also collect information from or about you from other sources, including through your contact with us, our Sales Support Department, or your results when you respond to a survey. Additionally, for quality and training purposes or for our own protection, we may monitor or record our telephone conversations with you or anyone acting on your behalf. By communicating with Rodan + Fields, you acknowledge that your communication may be overheard, monitored, or recorded without further notice or warning, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
   1. When you make a purchase on our Site, We collect from you the information required to make a purchase — such as your full name, email address, credit card number, shipping, and billing addresses. If you change your mind about storing this information, you can email the Sales Support Department at salessupport@rodanandfields.com to amend or delete this information. If you would prefer that we not collect any such Personal Information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. Please note that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, your credit card or debit card information (“Credit Card Holder’s Information” or “CCHI”) will be used for payment on the spot, and it may be kept in your account in a tokenized format for future payments or regular payments. Rodan + Fields does not handle any CCHI on its own, and such CCHI is handled by external operators that manage the CCHI in accordance with the PCI data security standards and other industrial standards.

</p>
<p>
   2. Please note that if you choose to share Personal Information about yourself in an open format, such as through a Third-Party Site like Facebook or Twitter, some of that information could be deemed public and may lose certain protections under applicable privacy laws.
</p>
<p>
  3.  Anonymous Data: Because Personal Information is information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person, information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We may aggregate general information such as your geographic location, age group, gender, product and/or cosmetic concerns, and brands and products used. Such aggregated information does not constitute Personal Information of any specific user.
</p>
<p>
   <span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;"> HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br>
   Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your Personal Information to:
</p>
<p>
   1. Process transactions and send notices about your transactions. When you make a purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address, and other information related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment Information") from you, and use such Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase.
</p>
<p>
   2. Provide marketing information and newsletters to you regarding our products and promotions. If you prefer not to receive such emails, please see the section below entitled Choice/Opt-Out. You may receive the benefit of hearing from Rodan + Fields via postal mail or phone even if you have opted-out from receiving these marketing emails, unless you explicitly withdraw your consent to our use of your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  3.  Permit emails to friends. We may provide the functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, you may provide us with your friend's email address so that we can facilitate the sending of your message to your friend. Please note that you are responsible for ensuring you have obtained permission from your friend before sharing your friend’s information with us.
</p>
<p>
    4.Provide sales support.
</p>
<p>
    5. Send administrative communications regarding the Site, service-related announcements, etc., which are necessary to serve you, respond to your concerns, and provide the high level of customer service that Rodan + Fields offers. Because this information is needed to enable your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications unless you close your account with us.
</p>
<p>
    6.Verify your identity, including during account creation and password reset processes.
</p>
<p>
    7.Manage risk, or to detect, prevent, and/or remediate suspicious account activity or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities.

    11.Detect, prevent, or remediate violations of our Terms and Conditions or Policies and Procedures, as stated in the Consultant Agreement.

If you so choose, we may share your name, phone number, email address, and other Personal Information with Independent Consultants, who may, in turn, share your Personal Information with their Upline organization (those Independent Consultants who directly or indirectly sponsor the Independent Consultant (an “Upline”)). Independent Consultants may use this information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and the Consultant Agreement, including to follow up on orders you placed on the Site or contact you with other special offers from Rodan + Fields.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">OUR USE AND YOUR CHOICES REGARDING COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</span>
    <br>
    Like many other websites and applications, our Site may, directly or through trusted third parties, use cookies, pixels, or similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) for the purposes described in this section and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
</p>    
<p>This section helps you understand what Tracking Technologies are, how we use them, and the options that you have.</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">What are Cookies and Pixels?:</span> Cookies are a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a user's computer or other device when they visit a website. Cookies permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using the same computer or device. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as to support customization of our marketing and advertising activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages.</p>
    <p>
        
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">How do we use Tracking Technologies?:</span> The Site may use Tracking Technologies to gather information, customize your visit, and enable us to enhance our services (including through personalized advertisement.) For example, we use Tracking Technologies to recognize you as a previous user of the Site so you do not have to enter your Personal Information every time, and to offer you personalized content. We may use the information gathered through Tracking Technologies to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns, and purchases. In some cases, we may link tracking information with Personal Information. We may also use these technologies to help us better manage content, such as by improving the user interface. Finally, we also use these technologies (directly or through service providers) to build a better picture of the type of offers and products that you might be interested in, for location-based advertising (including through push notifications as described below), cross-device matching, and interest-based advertising. 
<ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Location-Based Advertising:</span> To the extent our Site has a corresponding App, we may use our App to obtain the user’s precise location (if the user of the App permits the App to request and collect this information from the applicable mobile device.) We may also determine a zip code from the precise location data received from an App user’s mobile device. Users of the Site also may elect to provide us with their zip code directly. We may use general location data, preferences, or other information received from the Site, including through your mobile device such as through the App, to send you tailored marketing messages based on your location, including making product recommendations. Additionally, we may use information to engage in interactive, real-time discussions with users, which we or the users may initiate. If you would like to opt-out of location-based advertising, please see the choices section below.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Cross-Device Matching:</span> We may now or in the future use the data collected through Tracking Technologies (directly by us or by our service providers) and other data (i.e. deterministic data such as unique identifiers) to make educated predictions that give us the ability to match your devices. We may then, subject to the limitations otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy and applicable law, display targeted advertisements to you across your devices (unless you have opted-out for a particular device as described in the options section below.)</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Interest-Based Advertising:</span> We may use the information we collect (alone or in combination with information provided by third parties and service providers) through Tracking Technologies (which may be combined with other Personal Information such as your email address) to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our Site or elsewhere. For example, if you are searching our Site for information on a particular product, we may use that information to cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view promoting a product that matches your search. We also partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you or your business. Our partners may place or recognize a tracking technology placed on your computer, device, or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share Personal Information with them for interest-based advertising purposes. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Your options:</span> You may choose to decline Tracking Technologies by adjusting your browser preferences, but doing so may affect your use of the Site and your ability to access certain features or engage in certain transactions through the Site. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, cookies that the Site may have used in the past (or an opt-out cookie) may no longer work.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out:</span> As described in this Privacy Notice and to the extent permitted by law, we may collect (or allow third parties such as ad networks, web analytics companies, and social networking platforms to collect) information about your online activities over time and across our Sites and other third-party online properties or services. These third parties may use information about your visits to our Site and other sites, and general geographic information in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. This is a site offered by the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") that includes information on how consumers can opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, which is a site offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") that includes information on how consumers can opt-out of receiving internet-based advertising from some or all of DAA's participating companies. Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see any advertisements; rather, you will still see advertisements that are general and not tailored to your specific interests and activities</li>
<li>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">  Device-Based Opt-Out: </span>In general, opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not necessarily be effective on your mobile device. In the event we are performing cross-device matching (as described above), once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”), we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes and we will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.

</li>
</ul>    
</p>
<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;"> TRANSFER OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE YOUR HOME COUNTRY</span>

Because Rodan + Fields is headquartered in the United States, we may transfer information collected from our non-U.S. customers to the U.S. similarly, we may also transfer our customer information (regardless of where you live) to other countries or places in which we maintain offices or do business, including Australia, Canada, and Japan. By using a Rodan + Fields website or application or by otherwise doing business with Rodan + Fields, you are agreeing to allow us to transfer your information outside your home country and to process it inside the United States or elsewhere for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">  LAW ENFORCEMENT; EMERGENCIES; COMPLIANCE</span>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information to others as we believe to be appropriate: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to respond to governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms and Conditions; (d) to protect our operations; (e) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Rodan + Fields, you or others; and (f) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. We may disclose any information we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including Personal Information, with other companies and organizations for credit protection and risk reduction.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">CHILDREN UNDER 13</span>

Our Site is not directed to and we do not knowingly collect information from children under thirteen (13). Under our Terms and Conditions, children are not permitted to use our Site or services.
</p>
<p>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> LINKS</span><br>

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. These linked sites are not under Rodan + Fields' control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Rodan + Fields. If you provide any Personal Information through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on the third-party's website (not the Site) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">HOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION</span>
    We realize that our customers trust us to protect their Personal Information. We take that task seriously. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We implement various security measures and tools, such as firewalls, to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to guarantee the confidentiality of online transactions made on our Site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet help protect your online transaction information from third-party interception.</li>
        <li>We never display your full credit card number once it is entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.</li>
        <li>Data transmission over the Internet or data storage system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. There is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account that you might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem by emailing us at privacy@rodanandfields.com.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> MEASURES YOU CAN TAKE</span>

It is important for you to play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer.
</p>
<p>
   <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> UPDATING AND ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</span>

You have the ability to change and/or correct the Personal Information that you provide us by emailing us at privacy@rodanandfields.com. Under applicable law, you may have the right to ask in writing whether we hold any Personal Information about you, to see that information, and request additional details as to how we collect, use or disclose your Personal Information. We may not be able to provide you with all the information that you request, depending on the circumstances, and there may be a charge for any copy of Personal Information requested. You may request that we deactivate your account by emailing us at privacy@rodanandfields.com.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which applicable law may allow us to retain. We may contact former users of the Site who have not explicitly withdrawn consent to such communications in accordance with applicable laws.

You may withdraw your permission to collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. However, without your permission, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you have requested.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">OPT-OUT FOR MARKETING & PROMOTIONAL CORRESPONDENCE</span>
    You may opt-out of receiving future emails from Rodan + Fields. Please note that this opt-out only applies to Rodan + Fields promotional emails. You may opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails by using the opt-out mechanism in the footer of the email itself or by emailing us at optout@rodanandfields.com.

We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that opting-out as described above will not remove your information from our databases or the databases of Independent Consultants or third parties. If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such Independent Consultants or third parties, please contact such Consultants or third parties directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.
