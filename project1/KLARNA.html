        <div class="content">
            <p>We’re excited to announce we have partnered with Klarna to bring you a new way to pay at checkout.

                Klarna is an alternate payment method that allows you to split your purchase into 4 interest-free payments. To use Klarna to pay for your purchase, add products to your cart and select “Klarna” when you check out. Enter a few personal details and you’ll know instantly if you’re approved. Your purchase will be split into 4 interest-free payments and the first payment will be taken from your credit or debit card when your order is shipped. The remaining three payments will be automatically charged to your card 14, 28, and 42 days later. Klarna will send you an email confirmation and reminders when it’s time to pay and there are no interest or fees when you pay on time. You can read about Klarna’s terms and conditions and privacy policy for additional information. https://www.klarna.com/us/privacy/</p>

After your order is shipped, you will be charged for the first quarter of the total amount. Klarna will send a notification once the payment has been processed. You will be informed ahead of time before the next payments.</p>
