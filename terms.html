            <b>3.ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS</b>
            <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, WITH RODAN + FIELDS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. SECTION 3 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”, AS NOTED ABOVE.</p>
            <p>EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS THAT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING: THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION; THE RIGHT TO HAVE JUDICIAL APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATOR’S FINDINGS; THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL; AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM.</p>
            <p>Scope of Arbitration Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Rodan + Fields agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms, your visit to the Site, our Products (including but not limited to product liability actions), or any purchase, return or other transaction with Rodan + Fields or our Consultants, affiliates, or vendors (each, a “Claim”) shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except as provided below.</p>
            <p>Limitations of Arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator can award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.</p>
            <P>

                Small Claims Court. In lieu of arbitration, either you or Rodan + Fields may assert individual claims in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis, non-class, non-representative basis.</P>
       <p>Intellectual Property Claims. Notwithstanding the other provisions in this Section 3, if Rodan + Fields has a reasonable basis to believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate any of Rodan + Fields’s intellectual property rights, Rodan + Fields may bring suit in any state or federal court in the state of California, rather than through arbitration. You agree that you will submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the state of California.</p>
       <p>Initiating Arbitration. Any party who intends to seek arbitration must first provide to the other party a written notice of the Claim (“Notice”), describing the facts and circumstances of the Claim and the specific relief sought, and including any supporting documentation. The Notice must be mailed via certified or registered mail to: Rodan + Fields at [ADDRESS], or to you at your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your online profile. If we are unable to reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration. Notice of any Claim must be provided within one year after the Claim arises, or it shall be barred forever, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <p>Procedures. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with either the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, depending on the nature of the dispute, and as amended by these Terms. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed location.</p>        
      <p>Class Action Waiver. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Rodan + Fields agree that ANY CLAIM RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, AND ANY OTHER CONSOLIDATED, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY SUCH ACTION. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that you will not be a member of any putative or actual class in a class action brought by anyone else, nor will you seek to become a class representative. Unless we both agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of other persons with yours, or ours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class arbitration proceeding.</p>
     <p>

        Authority of the Arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement or any other provision of these Terms or in the American Arbitration Association’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the foregoing class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.</p>
        <p>Batch Arbitrations. To increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 10 or more similar arbitration demands against Rodan + Fields, presented by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organization, are submitted to an arbitration provider selected in accordance with the rules described above within a 30-day period, the arbitration provider shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 10 demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 10 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one arbitrator assigned per batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Rodan + Fields and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, or an approach similar to the batch approach described above, including but not limited to procedures, costs, and fees. This batch approach will not apply for product liability claims.</p>
        <P>

            Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including without limitation the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Section, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
            </P>
            <p>

                Survival After Termination. This Section 3 will survive after the Terms terminate or your use of the Site ends. If any portion of this Section is found to be void or unenforceable as to a particular Claim, then that Claim (and only that Claim) shall be resolved in federal court rather than in arbitration; if there is no federal jurisdiction, the case shall be resolved in state court in California.
                
                </p>     
    </p>
