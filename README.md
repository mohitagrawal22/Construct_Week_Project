This project is a clone of "https://www.rodanandfields.com/", which is a skin care and beauty Products website. This is a collaborative project, completed within 6 days with a team of 4 members, as a part of the 'Construct-week' project at Masai School unit-2. This website has end-to-end functionalities from Signup/login and adding products and removing the products from the cart page. We had added many sorting techniques to sort the products on their respective pages based on their ratings, and prices, alphabetically.
